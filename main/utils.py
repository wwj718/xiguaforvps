    Take some queryset (links or comments) and order them by score,

    scale is a constant that can be used to control how quickly scores
    reduce over time. To perform this in the database, it needs to
    support a POW function, which Postgres and MySQL do. For databases
    that don't such as SQLite, we perform the scoring/sorting in
